**Sync**: If you open VLC to listen X, close VLC and quickly open VLC again to listen Y: X will still be sync â€” according to Y (normally, only Y has to be sync in this case). **PARTIALLY FIXED** (because not optimal solution): a delay of 5 seconds had been added before open VLC, to give the time to X session to close).

**MINOR**

`bug_id: 4b3045`
